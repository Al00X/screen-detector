> üñ®Ô∏è _Get your device screen type reactively!_ in Angular.


## ‚úÖ Setup:
Install using your preferred package manager:

    npm i @al00x/screen-detector

## ‚ú® Usage:
`ScreenDetectorService` it's all you need!

```html
<div *NgIf="screenDetector.isDesktop$ | async">
  Render when reached desktop breakpoint
</div>

<!-- The below *NgIf condition, it's always true -->
<ng-container *NgIf="{state: screenDetector.state$ | async} as screen">
  XL Breakpoint? {{ screen.xl ? 'YES' : 'NO'}}
</ng-container>
```

There's 6: `xxl, xl, lg, md, sm, xs` breakpoint types, also with utility: `isDesktop` which is defaulted as `lg` and it's changeable.

You can also check the example files for various usages: [Playground](playground/src/app)

### ‚öôÔ∏è Config:
You can config screen detector for more customization by providing `ALX_SCREEN_DETECTOR_CONFIG`.

```ts
// component.ts

@Component({
  ...,
  providers: [
    {
      provide: ALX_SCREEN_DETECTOR_CONFIG,
      useValue: {
        ...,
        // The breakpoints below are the default values that are the same as default TailwindCSS breakpoints.
        breakpoints: {
          xxl: 1536,
          xl: 1280,
          lg: 1024,
          md: 768,
          sm: 640,
          xs: 420,
        }
      } as AlxScreenDetectorConfig
    }
  ],
})
